# Ghana NLP API Developer Programme – Getting Started Guide

This guide helps developers quickly get started with the Ghana NLP API platform and prepare for participating in the API developer programme. It covers how to create an account, subscribe to a developer plan, access API documentation, and prepare for an optional demo session. If you're building projects that involve local language translation, speech, or text processing, this guide is your first step.

## Create Your Account

To start using the Ghana NLP APIs:

1. Create an account: [https://translation.ghananlp.org](https://translation.ghananlp.org)  
2. Subscribe to the Developer plan: [Developer Subscription](https://translation.ghananlp.org/product#product=developer)

   Notes:
   - The plan includes 100 free API calls per month.
   - A credit card is required for registration, but it won’t be charged under the free tier.
   - If you don’t have access to a credit card, email `subscriptions@algorine.com` with a short description of your project to request manual activation.
